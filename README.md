# You Should See This

A Google Chrome extension that lets users leave hidden links for each other. 

### Usage

A user navigates to a website that they think could be interesting for someone else. They open the extension and leave a pin.

The next user who opens up the extension and wants to see a website can open up the last pin and be brought to the last website any user pinned.
